### Contribute Documentation

Documentation is an important part of any project. It helps us keep track of what we're doing, how, and why. It's how we communicate our policies and guide others on how to use or contribute to the project. Any contribution to documentation is welcome, no matter how small. Even fixing a sentence or correcting a spelling mistake is appreciated!

**How to contribute:**

1. Check if there is already an existing pull request with the changes you want to make.
2. Create a "feature branch" for your changes to separate them from other changes.
3. Ensure your changes are well-formatted and consistent with the existing documentation.
4. Review and proofread your changes, and run a spellchecker if possible.
5. If your contribution is related to an open issue, provide a link to the issue in your pull request.
6. You can add new commits to your pull request later if needed.
7. Your pull request will be reviewed by maintainers, and they may request changes or provide feedback.
8. Once accepted, your changes will be merged into the main branch, and they will take effect in the next release.

### Contribute Code

Contributing code is an important way to keep the project active and functional. Code contributions of any size are welcome! However, it is essential to include relevant tests for the code changes or additions. Contributions without tests may require additional consideration from maintainers.

**How to contribute:**

1. Check if there is an existing pull request with your changes.
2. Create a "feature branch" to isolate your changes from other code.
3. Run the pre-checkin script to format, lint, build, and test your changes.
4. Ensure your changes are properly formatted and that all tests pass.
5. If your contribution is related to an open issue, provide a link to the issue in your pull request.
6. You can add new commits to your pull request later if necessary.
7. Reviewers will assess your pull request, and they may request changes or provide feedback.
8. Once accepted, your changes will be merged into the main branch, and they will take effect in the next release.

### Provide Support on Issues

Supporting other users with their questions is a valuable way to contribute to the community. Many issues in open-source projects are related to users seeking help or clarification. By assisting others, you can make a significant impact.

**How to provide support:**

1. Visit the issue tracker to find questions you can help with.
2. Read through the issues and choose the ones you feel comfortable answering.
3. Respond to the issue with clear and concise details or request additional information if needed.
4. Once the issue is resolved, ask the original poster or a maintainer to close it.
5. Remember to be kind, patient, and respectful when interacting with users, even if they're frustrated or impatient.
6. If someone violates the code of conduct, follow the guidelines in the Code of Conduct enforcement section to resolve the conflict.

### Review Pull Requests

Reviewing pull requests is another valuable way to contribute. When reviewing, it's important to be respectful and considerate of the time and effort the contributors have put into their work.

**How to review:**

1. Go to the pull requests section.
2. Familiarize yourself with the code or documentation changes, unless it's a minor modification.
3. Use the GitHub functionality to review the changes, such as commenting or suggesting specific lines of code.
4. Provide constructive feedback, suggestions, or ask clarifying questions.
5. Be polite and respectful in your comments, keeping in mind the goal is to improve the project.
6. Reviewers can approve the pull request or request changes.
7. Once approved, the pull request can be merged into the main branch.
