# Github Action: Kubeval Validation

This GitHub Action validates Kubernetes manifest files using kubeval (validation support for Helm and Kustomize)

## Usage

To use this action, include the following step in your workflow:

```yaml
- name: Validate Kubernetes Manifests
  uses: codewdhruv/kubeval-validation@v1.1.1
  with:
    directory: 'path/to/manifests'
```

The directory input should point to the directory containing your Kubernetes manifest files.

## Inputs

```directory (required):``` The directory containing the Kubernetes manifest files to validate.

## Outputs

```validation_result:``` The result of the Kubernetes manifest validation. It will be either "success" or "failure" based on the validation outcome.

## Example Workflow

```yaml

  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  validate_manifests:

    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
